# Word-Guess-Game

Created a halloween themed hangman styled game.

Press any key to guess the horror movie villian's names

When you win a picture of Freddy Kreuger shows up on the right side of the screen

When you lose a picture of Pennywise appears

Each time you win, your wins counter increases by one and holds a tally

Every letter you press is put in a bank at the bottom of the screen so you know which letters you have used already

Nothing happens when you press the same button over and over again

Additions I would have liked to make:

    Render dashes with a space between a two named characters
    Sound when you win and when you lose
    When you lose you see the character name you were trying to guess
    Have a hint with the movie name to make guessing easier
    Create a hangman that loses appendages with each wrong guess

Issues:

    Sometimes the win image and lose image appear for a second when refreshing the page.
